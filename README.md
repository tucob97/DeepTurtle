Edit: The project is no longer in development, but i have decided to keep it online to get ideas and useful code.

# DeepTurtle
I planned to program a poker agent for texas holdem.

When i have freetime I will publish my work under this project. DeepTurtle is my poker bot.
It is not already finish , but i will update my repository step by step until finish the project.
Until now I published stupidhares , the cousin of DeepTurtle. Fast but random and stupid. It play only one move, the preflop , and after there is only the showdown. The amount of bet are calculate whit gamma distribution whit 2 mean, later i set this whit the neural network. This is only for show.

First train the model on stupidmodel.py , simply run the code.
After open stupidhare.py and...

g= game(n) ---> n is the number of round you want to play.

g.initgame() ---> start the game
