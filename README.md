# DeepTurtle
artificial intelligence poker agent for texas holdem


For now on i published my work under this project. DeepTurtle is my poker bot A.I.
It is not already finish , but i will update my repository step by step until finish the project.
Until now i published stupidhares , the cousin of DeepTurtle. Fast but random and stupid.It play only one move, the preflop , and after there is only the showdown. The amount of bet are calculate whit gamma distribution whit 2 mean, later i set this whit the neural network. This is only for show.

First train the model on stupidmodel.py , simply run the code.
After open stupidhare.py and...

g= game(n) ---> n is the number of round you want to play.

g.initgame() ---> start the game
